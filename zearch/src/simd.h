	Description: Operations required to use SIMD.

	Example:
	Consider rule X → AB with the following pair of states connected by each variable:
		A: {(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)}
		B: {(1,3),(6,9),(2,11)}
	After compiling we have
		SIMD_A: origin = [1,3,4,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], destiny = [2,4,6,?,?,?,?,?], destiny = 5192534549066999519616422834601983L
		SIMD_B: origin = [1,6,9,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], destiny = [3,9,11,?,?,?,?,?], destiny = 5192772239599171410702349339983871L
	To search for coincidences of A_destiny and B_origin we apply the following algorithm
		For j in 1..3
			n = A_destiny[j]
			Compile [n,n,n,0,0,0,0,0] → x
			SIMD_compare x, 5192772239599171410702349339983871 → aux
			For i in aux
				if i \neq 0
					Found concatenation A_origin[j] → B_origin[i] → B_destiny[i]

	Properties:
		* There is no transition ending on the initial state (by definition of the extended saturation construction this case assumption is completely safe.)
		* Meant to perform the operations related to the saturation construction, i.e., joint of binary relation.
		* Each element is a 16*bits value and represents the original/final state of a transition.
		* Notation: Assume we are processing 'A' in rule 'X → AB'
