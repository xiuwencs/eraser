/*
	Description: Implementation of a Non deterministic Finite Automaton.

	This data structure is the core of ZEARCH and it is accessed from different modules, each one
	performing a different action. We have made it public (types.h) to simplify the implementation
	since modules "count" and "nfa" both handle it while being TODO

	typedef struct {
		unsigned char initial[NUM_PAIRS_INITIAL];
		unsigned char final[NUM_PAIRS_INITIAL];
		short first_block;
		short first_index;
		unsigned int count : 24; // This allow us to count, easily, up to 2**24 = 16777216
		unsigned char new_lines : 2; // Can be 0, 1 or 2
		unsigned char is_there : 1;
		// Variables for counting
		unsigned char match : 1;
		unsigned char right : 1;
		unsigned char left : 1;
		unsigned char pairs_used : BITS_PAIRS_USED;
	} TRANSITION_FULL;

	Properties:
		* Implemented as an array of lists: automaton = TRANSITION_FULL[num_rules].
		* Each array corresponds to a variable in the grammar, which will label some transitions.
		* Each lists contains the pairs of states (q1, q2) connected by that label.
		* Uses count module to do the counting.
		* Includes operations required to perform the saturation construction.
